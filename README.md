# Graph Plotter

This is a simple tool that allows graphs to be plotted.

Basic Features:
 - Plot graph from CSV file of data
 - Add graph title and axes labels
 - Limit both x and y axes
 - Add error bars and legends
 - Full RGB support and line styles
 - Live graph preview
 - Support for PDF plotting

Currently reworking how plotting works to allow for easier plotting of multiple data sets and other plot elements.
